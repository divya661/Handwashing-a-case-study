# Handwashing-A Case Study from 1800's

## Introduction

Dr. Semmelweis was worried about the situation of huge rate of women death just after giving childbirth while working in a hospital.  

#### Steps followed in project:

1. Libraries & dataset has been imported.
2. Proportion of deaths/ no of births is calculated yearly in 2 clinics & lineplot is plotted on `Proportion deaths` VS `deaths` showing deaths rate in Clinic1 is much higher than Clinic2
3.  Proportion of deaths/ no of births is calculated monthly & graph is ploted tostudy the effect of handwashing on reduction in deaths.
4. As on date `1847-06-01` made compulsory hand-washing, the before & after effects are visualized again.
5. Reduction in monthly proportion of deaths on average is calculated.
6. Bootstrap analysis of Semmelweis handwashing data is done.
